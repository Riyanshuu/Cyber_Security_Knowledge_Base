| Protocol  | TCP/UDP | Port Number | Use |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| FTP (File Transfer Protocol) | TCP | 20/21 (20 - Data Transfer, 21 - FTP Control) | Most commonly used file transfer protocol on the internet and within private networks. An FTP server can easily be setup with little networking knowledge and provides the ability to easily relocate files from one system to another. |
| SSH (Secure Shell) | TCP | 22 | SSH is the primary method used to manage network devices securely at the command level. It is typically used as a secure alternative to Telnet which does not support secure connections. |
| Telnet | TCP  | 23 | Telnet is the primary method used to manage network devices at the command level. Unlike SSH which provides a secure connection, Telnet does not, it simple provides a basic unsecure connection. |
| SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol) | TCP | 25 | SMTP is used for two primary functions, it is used to transfer main (email) from source to destination between mail servers and it is used by end users to send email to mail system. |
| DNS (Domain Name System) | TCP/UDP | 53 | The DNS is used widely on the public internet and on private networks to translate domain names into IP addresses, typically for network routing. DNS is hieratical with main root servers that contain databases that list the managers of high level Top Level Domains (TLD). Example: .com |
| DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol) | UDP | 67/68 (67 - Server, 68 - Client) | DHCP is used on networks that do not use static IP address assignment (almost all of them). A DHCP server can be set up by an administrator or engineer with a poll of addresses that are available for assignment. When a client device is turned on it can request an IP address from the local DHCP server, if there is an available server in the pool, it can be assigned to the device. |
| TFTP (Trivial File Transfer Protocol) | UDP | 69 | TFTP offers a method of file transfer without the session establishment requirements that FTP uses. Because TFTP used UPD instead of TCP, it has no way of ensuring the file has been properly transferred, the end device must be able to check the file to ensure proper transfer. TFTP is typically used by devices to upgrade software and firmware; this includes Cisco and other network vendorsâ€™ equipment. |
| HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol | TCP | 80 | HTTP is the main protocol that is used by web browsers and is thus used by any client that uses files located on these servers. |
| POP v3 (Post Office Protocol) | TCP | 110 | POPv3 is one of the two main protocols used to retrieve mail from the server. POP was designed to be very simple by allowing the client to retrieve the complete contents of a server mailbox and then deleting the contents from the server. |
| NTP (Network Time Protocol) | UDP  | 123 | NTP is used to synchronize the devices on the internet. Even most modern operating systems support NTP as a basis for keeping an accurate clock. The use of NTP is vital on networking systems as it provides an ability to easily interrelate troubles from one device to another as the clocks are precisely accurate. |
| NetBIOS | TCP/UDP | 137/138/139  | NetBIOS itself is not a protocol but is typically used in combination with IP with the NetBIOS over TCP/IP (NBT) protocol. NBT has long been the central protocol used to interconnect Microsoft Windows Machine. 137(TCP/UDP) - Name service for name registration and resolution, 138(UDP) - Datagram distribution service for connectionless communication, 139(TCP) - Session service for connection-oriented communication |
| IMAP (Internet Message Access Protocol) | TCP | 143 | Used to retrieve mail from the server. IMAP supports a wider array of remote mailbox operations which can be helpful to users. |
| SNMP (Simple Network Management Protocol) | TCP/UDP | 161/162 | SNMP is used by network administrators as a method of network management. SNMP has different ability to monitor, configure and control network devices. |
| BGP (Border Gateway Protocol) | TCP | 179 | BGPv4 is widely used on the public internet and by ISPs to maintain very large routing tables and traffic processing. It is designed to deal with the astronomically large routing tables that must exist on the public internet. |
| LDAP (Lightweight Directory Access Protocol) | TCP/UDP | 389 | LDAP provides a mechanism of accessing and maintaining distributed directory information. It allows anyone to locate data about organizations, individuals and other resources such as files and devices in a network. |
| HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol over SSL/TLS) | TCP | 443 | Secure version of HTTP. Provide same function as HTTP but using a secure connection provided by either SSL or TLS. |
| LDAPS (Lightweight Directory Access Protocol over TLS/SSL) | TCP/UDP | 636 | Just like HTTPS, LDAPS provides same function as LDAP but over a secure connection provided by either SSL or TLS. |
| FTP over TLS/SSL | TCP | 989/990 | Just like the above two entries, FTP over SSL/TLS provides same function as FTP but over a secure connection provided by either SSL or TLS. |
| RDP (Remote Desktop Protocol) | TCP | 3389 | RDP is a Microsoft proprietary protocol that enables remote connections to other computers. It provides network access for a remote user over an encrypted network. |
