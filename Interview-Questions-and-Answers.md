- **Difference between router and switch?**
    
    
    | Router | Switch |
    | --- | --- |
    | A Router is a Layer 3 Device. (Network Layer) | A Switch is a Layer 2 Device. (Data-link Layer) |
    | A Router is used to connect various networks. | A Switch is used to connect various devices in a network. |
    | Router can work with both wired & wireless networks. | Switch can only work with the wired network. |
    | A Router is compatible with NAT. | A Switch is not compatible with NAT. |
- **Difference between TCP and UDP?**
    
    
    | TCP | UDP |
    | --- | --- |
    | TCP is a connection-oriented protocol. | UDP is a connectionless protocol. |
    | TCP is comparatively slower than UDP. | UDP is faster and more efficient than TCP. |
    | TCP can guarantee delivery of data to the destination. | UDP cannot guarantee delivery of data to the destination. |
    | Retransmission of lost packets is possible in TCP. | UDP cannot retransmit lost packets. |
- **Difference between HTTP 1.0 and HTTP 1.1?**
    
    
    | HTTP 1.0 | HTTP 1.1 |
    | --- | --- |
    | Single request/response per connection. | Multiple requests/responses per connection. |
    | The host header is optional in HTTP 1.0 | The host header is required in HTTP 1.1 |
    | HTTP 1.0 can define 16 status codes. | HTTP 1.1 can define 24 status codes. |
    | In HTTP 1.0, authentication is unsafe as it is not encrypted. | In HTTP 1.1, authentication is safe as it uses a checksum of username, password and one time value. |
- **What is error 402, error 302 & error 02?**
    
    **402** - Payment Required 
    
    Indicates that the requested content is not available until the client makes a payment.
    
    **302** - Found Redirect 
    
    Indicates that the requested URL has been temporarily moved to a specific URL given by the location header.
    
    **202** - Accepted Response 
    
    Indicates that the request has been accepted for processing, but the processing has not been completed (or not even started).
    
- **Difference between TLS 1.0 and SSL 3.0?**
- **Difference between HTTP 1.1 and HTTP 2.0?**
    
    
    | HTTP 1.1 | HTTP 2.0 |
    | --- | --- |
    | It works on the textual format which means it sends messages as plain text. | It works on the binary protocol which means it encodes messages into binary data. |
    | It compresses data by itself. | It uses HPACK for data compression. |
    
        
- **Difference between HTTP and HTTPS?**
    
    
    | HTTP | HTTPS |
    | --- | --- |
    | Not Secure | Secure Connection |
    | Not Encrypted  | Highly Encrypted |
    | Works at Application Layer. | Works at Transport Layer. |
    | SSL certificates are not required. | SSL certificates are required. |
    | Faster than HTTPS. | Slower than HTTP due to encryption. |
